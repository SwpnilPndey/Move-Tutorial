## Compile and run Move language smart contracts in Aptos blockchain

- Open Windows Powershell as administrator 

- Goto https://aptos.dev/tools/aptos-cli/install-cli/automated-install and follow to install Move CLI

- Add the CLI execution to PATH using : setx PATH "%PATH%;C:\Users\Dell\.aptoscli\bin"

- Now check the version details using : aptos info

- Now install Move extension in VS code and from now on use VS code terminal for Move CLI

- Now create a folder and inside it use aptos move init --name testing

-  This creates few folders inside our working folder 

- Now initialise network and account private key : aptos init --network devnet. The private key is generated by CLI itself for testing purpose 

- Now copy the address which CLI generates to the Move.toml file under [addresses] and give it a name : 

MyAddr="..put the address here"

- Also, under addresses, define standard address for libraries as "0x1"

Std="0x1"
aptos_std="0x1"

- Now we can create new '.move' files inside sources folder
